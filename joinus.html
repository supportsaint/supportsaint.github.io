<h2> About Us </h2>
<p>
SupportSaint is a new, on-demand, technical support service. In addition to a complete range of technical support services, we also provide new technology consultation. We fix problems and can help architect a home’s tech eco-system.
<p>
Our focus is to offer the flexibility of on-demand IT support to all people at home including those working from home or people starting or running a small business.  	
<p>
In today’s world of connected devices and the Internet of Things, our mission is to make the newest in technology available and understandable to all. We’re making technology in the home simple.
</p>
<h2> The Team </h2>
<p>
We are passionate techs, developers, designers and strategists dedicated to making technology accessible to everyone. Sharing our skills to support friends and family, we discovered that existing options for IT support can be expensive, often inferior and confusing so we set out to create the experience that we would want for everyone using tech at home.
<p>
Led by Glyn Thomas a seasoned IT professional who has provided IT project management, development and support to business of all sizes for over 20 years, SupportSaint is on a mission to change tech support as we know it. 
<p>
SupportSaint is based in SW18, South West London.

<p>Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).</p>

<p>We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.</p>

<p>The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p>

<p>Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</p>

However please see clause 6.3 for what happens if (i) we discover an error in the price of the Services you order or (ii) we identify, in the course of providing the Services, issues or problems that we think may or will impact the timing required to complete the Services.

<div class="faq4 s2-blue title-std expand-detail-btn sec-padding-std">How do I set up an appointment?</div>
<div id="faq4" class="detail sec-padding-std" style="display: none;">
<p class="copy-std text-max"> From the home page, simply select the option to book an appointment. You will be asked to provide basic information about your issues. Whilst it is always helpful to receive as much information as possible, please just provide what you can. Once you have submitted your booking, you’ll receive a confirmation email with an appointment date and time.  Please note that because we carefully consider information included within each request for an appointment, feedback of an appointment date and time is not automated or instantaneous but we will get back to you as soon as we can. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="faq5 s2-blue title-std expand-detail-btn sec-padding-std">What if I don’t know what’s wrong?</div>
<div id="faq5" class="detail sec-padding-std" style="display: none;">
<p class="copy-std text-max"> Not a problem. When setting up your appointment, select “Other” for the service type and try as best you can to describe the issue in the description area. If we need any more information, we’ll contact you. </p>

<div class="faq6 s2-blue title-std expand-detail-btn sec-padding-std">How soon can I schedule my appointment?</div>
<div id="faq6" class="detail sec-padding-std" style="display: none;">
<p class="copy-std text-max"> We can offer appointments as soon as next-day. We know how busy you are and so we can offer agreed appointment times as opposed to a wider “morning or afternoon slot” to avoid you waiting around.  If you have an urgent issue, please call Support on 077 4570 4570. We’ll do everything we can to accommodate you. As our service expands, we hope to be able to offer same-day service in as little as 2 hours. </p>

<div class="faq7 s2-blue title-std expand-detail-btn sec-padding-std">How much will the SupportSaint services cost?</div>
<div id="faq7" class="detail sec-padding-std" style="display: none;">
<p class="copy-std text-max"> The charges for our services are £60 per hour. When we confirm a booking we will provide you with information about the minimum cost for the appointment based upon the information provided to us.  As the nature of technology problems means that resolution of issues may take longer than envisaged (depending upon the cause and extent of the problems) the time estimated may be exceeded.  In the event a SupportSaint identifies that the initial time estimate may not be sufficient to resolve the issue he/she will immediately let you know and discuss with you how long they think this will take and agree a way forward with you. </p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="faq8 s2-blue title-std expand-detail-btn sec-padding-std">How do I pay for the SupportSaint service?</div>
<div id="faq8" class="detail sec-padding-std" style="display: none;">
<p class="copy-std text-max"> Payment for the service is required at the end of the appointment. For your convenience, and so that our SupportSaint techs don't have to handle payments, we offer on-line payment using Paypal. If you are not happy to use an online payment, or bank transfer, it is important that you let us know before the appointment is confirmed so that we can arrange an alternative payment option. </p>

<p class="copy-std text-max"> Your SupportSaint will arrive at the date and time we have previously agreed with you during the scheduling (confirmation of the booking) of the appointment. As the majority of our SupportSaints use public transport to travel to appointments we kindly ask you to allow us a 15 minute window around (before and after) the agreed appointment time to arrive. Your SupportSaint will arrive at the date and time specified during scheduling 15 mins either way - no 4 hour windows of time at SupportSaint. </p>

Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of certain services where, for instance, some devices may be beyond repair, may not work due to environmental considerations, may require solutions which you are not able or willing to adopt, are as a result of problems that are beyond the scope of SupportSaint’s services or as a result of issues which were not identified at the time the confirmed booking / appointment was made. In the rare instances we identify these types of issues during the confirmed booking / appointment we will, of course, let you know immediately.
